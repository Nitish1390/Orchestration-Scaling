Graded Assignment on Monitoring, Scaling and Automation

Develop a system that automatically manages the lifecycle of a web application hosted on  EC2 instances, monitors its health, and reacts to changes in traffic by scaling resources.  Furthermore, administrators receive notifications regarding the infrastructure's health and scaling events. 

Detailed Breakdown: 

1. Web Application Deployment: 

 - Use `boto3` to: 

 - Create an S3 bucket to store your web application's static files. 

 - Launch an EC2 instance and configure it as a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).  - Deploy the web application onto the EC2 instance. 

2. Load Balancing with ELB: 

 - Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using `boto3`. 

 - Register the EC2 instance(s) with the ALB. 

3. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Configuration: 

 - Using `boto3`, create an ASG with the deployed EC2 instance as a template. 

 - Configure scaling policies to scale in/out based on metrics like CPU utilization or network traffic. 

4. Lambda-based Health Checks & Management: 

 - Develop a Lambda function to periodically check the health of the web application  (through the ALB). 

 - If the health check fails consistently, the Lambda function should: 

 - Capture a snapshot of the failing instance for debugging purposes.

 - Terminate the problematic instance, allowing the ASG to replace it.  - Send a notification through SNS to the administrators. 

5. S3 Logging & Monitoring: 

 - Configure the ALB to send access logs to the S3 bucket. 

 - Create a Lambda function that triggers when a new log is added to the S3 bucket. This function can analyze the log for suspicious activities (like potential DDoS attacks) or just high traffic. 

 - If any predefined criteria are met during the log analysis, the Lambda function sends a  notification via SNS. 

6. SNS Notifications: 

 - Set up different SNS topics for different alerts (e.g., health issues, scaling events, high traffic). 

 - Integrate SNS with Lambda so that administrators receive SMS or email notifications. 

7. Infrastructure Automation: 

 - Create a single script using `boto3` that: 

 - Deploys the entire infrastructure. 

 - Updates any component as required. 

 - Tears down everything when the application is no longer needed. 

8. Optional Enhancement â€“ Dynamic Content Handling: 

 - Store user-generated content or uploads on S3. 

 - When a user uploads content to the web application, it gets temporarily stored on the  EC2 instance. A background process (or another Lambda function) can move this to the S3  bucket and update the application's database to point to the content's new location on S3. 

Objectives: 

- Gain a comprehensive understanding of key AWS services and their integration. - Understand the lifecycle of a dynamic web application and its infrastructure.

- Learn how to automate infrastructure deployment and management tasks using boto3. - Experience with real-time monitoring and alerting systems.
